android studio development
I have Android Studio 4.0 on a few laptops, 
multiple monitors and devices in support of my development effort.
The assets I now have are a step forward from using a single 
laptop and device. I have had few other steps forward. I hope Github 
will be a effective asset along a stubborn learning curve.
