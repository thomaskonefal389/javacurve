android studio development

I have Android Studio 4.0 on a few laptops, 
multiple monitors and devices in support of my development effort.
The assets I now have are a step forward from using a single 
laptop and device. Zero to a credible app is far, imho. ZX10-RR should not be your first bike. Android Studio is  safer, but only physically. It's just as scary.

Github will be a effective asset along a stubborn learning curve.
